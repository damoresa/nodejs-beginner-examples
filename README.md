### NodeJS beginner guide

These examples aim to provide working examples 
for beginners to get the ropes on how to develop 
_REST API_ services using _NodeJS_ and its frameworks.

The following topics are covered:

1. Introduction to _JavaScript_, including language features,
_NodeJS_ specific features - such as package management - and 
flow control mechanisms.
1. Setting up and configuring _express_ to develop _REST APIs_. 
This section includes pretty much everything you need to know to 
get started with _express_ as well as good practices and 
recommendations.

Some exercises will also rely on _thin2-mocker_ which is a CLI 
tool used to mock APIs automatically using their _Swagger_/
_OpenAPI 2.0_ specification file.
